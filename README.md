# UdaciCards

It's a mobile flashcards app created with React Native and tested in iOS and Android platforms.

### Installing

I'm assuming that you have React Native installed properly.

First clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/andysfran/udacicards.git
```

Go to the folder directory

```
cd udacicards
```

Install all the dependencies

```
npm install OR yarn
```

Start the project

```
npm start OR yarn start
```

Choose the platform that you want to run and have fun!

```
P.S: If you are using a real device, you need to download the Expo app in your App store.
```
